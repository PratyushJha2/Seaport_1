Perhaps unsurprisingly, China by far takes the #1 spot for the number of seaports in the 
top 500, because of Chinese dominance in manufacturing. The US takes the number 2 spot, despite
having less than half of China's representation in the top 500. China is the more populous country and far more
dominant export-wise, although the US's high ranking makes sense because of how geographically diverse and
demanding the country is. Third place may have came as a surprise to some, considering The Netherlands
is not an economic powerhouse like China or the US, or even some countries lower on the list like Japan or 
India. The Netherlands, however, is a country built largely on sea trade and features Europe's busiest 
seaport in Rotterdam.
